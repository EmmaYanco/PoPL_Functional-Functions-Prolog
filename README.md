Problem 1:
==========
(a) Write a relation dupList that takes two lists as arguments and is true if the second list is the first
list with every element duplicated. So, the query dupList([a,b,c], D). should return D =
[a,a,b,b,c,c].<br>
(b) Write a relation dupListTimes that takes three arguments, two lists and an integer N, and is
true if the second list is the first list with every element duplicated N times. For example, the
query dupListTimes([a,b], L, 4). should return L = [a,a,a,a,b,b,b,b].
